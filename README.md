### Analysis:

The generated bar graph shows a comparison of timepoints with each drug regimen. Capomulin has the most amount of timepoints while Propriva has the least amount of timepoints.

The generated pie plot shows that the entire study is closely split between male and female mice. Female mice made up for 49% of the population, whereas male mice accounted for 51% of the total population.

In the comparison shown in the box plot, the final tumor volume remained lowest with Capomulin and Ramicane when compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin.

The correlation of a mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.84. This can be considered a strong correlation and shows that as the mouse weight is increasing then the tumor volume is also increasing.
